I am a medical doctor and researcher with a profound passion for advancing knowledge in clinical epidemiology, cancer research, and surgical sciences. With years of diverse experience, my journey has been defined by academic distinction, innovative research, and impactful contributions to improve public health and patient outcomes.

## Education
I hold a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree from *Tehran University of Medical Sciences*, where I conducted my thesis on the epidemiology of benign vocal fold lesions. Complementing my clinical training, I completed a Master of Public Health (MPH) training at *Iran University of Medical Sciences*, with my thesis focusing on the [global assessment of breast cancer epidemiology and quality of care](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1137286/full).

## Professional Experience
Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Cao Lab](https://caolab.wustl.edu/), at *Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University in St. Louis (WashU)*, collaborating on cutting-edge projects in cancer epidemiology and surgery. I also contribute to the academic activities as a Teaching Assistant in Intermediate Epidemiology Course as a part of the [Master of Population Health Sciences program](https://mphs.wustl.edu/), guiding students in applying statistical methods to complex survey data and statistical analysis of clinical data.

Previously, I have worked as a [Research Data Analyst](https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/staff/11892/dr-sina-azadnajafabad?preview=1) in the *Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, University of Leeds*, where I specialized in data analysis of clinical cohort datasets and biomarkers research, and as a Research Fellow in the *Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center*, at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, leading numerous projects on clinical research, Global Burden of Disease, and public health.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie at the intersection of clinical epidemiology and surgery, with a focus on cancer prevention, early detection, and outcomes research. I am particularly dedicated to studying gastrointestinal cancers, leveraging large datasets and real-world evidence to address emerging questions in cancer epidemiology trends.

## Achievements
* Ranked 1^st^ in the Master of Public Health entrance exam, *Iran University of Medical Sciences*.
* Awarded the Iranian exceptional scholars researcher program award
* Collaborator in the *Global Burden of Disease Study*, contributing to high-impact publications in prestigious journals.
* Editorial and peer-review experience in several leading journals, including PLOS One and Natureâ€™s Scientific Reports.

## Beyond Research
In addition to my academic pursuits, I am committed to community health. As a volunteer health educator, I have actively participated in programs to reduce cancer disparities and promote preventive health behaviors.

When not in the lab or classroom, I enjoy hiking, swimming, biking, and exploring new cuisines through cooking.
